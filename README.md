<h2>Configs for emulators which support individual config files</h2>

If you're like me and play a lot of games through emulators, you may have run into situations where the settings you commonly use are not optimal for the game you play. Remembering which settings work best with a given game is also a pain in the ass. Thus creating a need for an individual configuration, which this repository provides.

Will provide scripts, configuration files and game lists as time goes on.
